# Contester answers

This repo contains all valid answers to all the weeks of AITU contester tasks solved by me.

## __IMPORTANT!__
This repo was not created with the intention of letting students cheat with those "free" answers! It was created to help them improve their problem-solving skills by learning the basics of programming. Some students may get stuck on some tasks due to a variety of reasons, like poor task conditions or lack of test examples. Therefore, this repo exists as a little help/guide.

Not all the solutions in this repo are perfect and can be provided as examples of how to write clean & maintainable code! And I am completely aware of that writing:
```cpp
using namespace std;
```
is a bad practice and can lead to name collisions. But in learning purposes & in terms of competitive programming it's fine, since all the tasks are input-output related.
